# Some naming conventions etc:

All runnable code is named `main_.*.py`, with the title being intended
to describe what the program does.  `.py` files underneath this repo's
home directory are class definitions.

To get a sense of how things fit together, `main_json_harness.py`
is a bit of a template.
