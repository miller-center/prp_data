# Some naming conventions etc:

All runnable code is named `main_.*.py`, with the title being intended
to describe what the program does.  `.py` files underneath this repo's
home directory are class definitions.

To get a sense of how things fit together, `main_json_harness.py`
is a bit of a template.

NB, in order to run any of the programs supplied here you'll need to
create a directory inside this project's home dir called `prp-drupal-data`.  Inside
this directory you'll need a json file containing a bunch of PRP drupal
node data called `all-prp-text.json` (and some other files for some of
the programs).  Talk to Miles if you want the data.
